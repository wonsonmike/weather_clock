# Overview

This is a watch face for a Fitbit Sense. The battery indicator on the left side will darken based on the battery percentage. 
Weather details are obtained through the Open Weather Map API. The UV indicator on the right side similarly changes based on the current UV index. 
The weather at the top shows the weather for the current hour, plus the next 3 hours. There is an icon for the weather conditions and the temperature shown. 
In the middle, there's the time, date, and location.
At the bottom is the current heart rate of the user, the amount of steps taken that day, and the distance traveled that day by foot.

# Development Environment

This is mainly javascript, with some basic css. Node.js was used, and I used the Open Weather Map API.

# Future Work

- Add other weather API options
- Add other color scheme options
- Add a Settings page for the user to enter their own API key(s)
